Image Processing using Iris dataset and Swedish data set
The swedish dataset can be found in the following link since I could not upload it here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dyK6zRya5DUUbXsspSa6FEvienQ6lNtP?usp=sharing
The project is splitted into 2 part: you can either run any of the projects. 
When running project.py change the path of the dataset so that you can be able to use it when running the code
The easy way to run the project.py file is to use colaboratory which you can find it on google as using the link : https://colab.research.google.com/
In colab you will copy and paste the code in project.py then make sure that the dataset is within your google drive 
path: /content/drive/MyDrive/leaf-classification/images/images/78.jpg
this is the path you can use in colab once you have given it access your google drive, make sure that the dataset is in your 'MyDrive' so that you can see it in colab


when running accuracy.py make sure that the iris.csv file is in the same directory as the accuracy.py file
this one can be run on your machine but you can also you colaboratory if you don't want to install the packages
path : /content/drive/MyDrive/iris.csv
